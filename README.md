This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version with robust error handling. The issue involves parsing a user ID from a route parameter without sufficient validation, which can lead to crashes or unexpected responses if the ID is not a valid integer.  The solution includes input validation and appropriate error handling to gracefully manage invalid input.
